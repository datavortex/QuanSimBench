Please test your computer as follows:

1- First run the benchmark until you get the highest performance in the column "States/s". That usually corresponds to the 
largest number of nodes, or to the largest number of qubits that you can simulate (column Qubits). 
Verify that you get the "Pass=yes" result on all rows.

2- Submit the following fields in a text file to santiago.betelu@datavortex.com 
- Institution
- Computer details: name, number of nodes, CPU name, physical cores per node used, total physical cores used, network
- Qubits (as said before, for which states/s is largest) 
- Rawtime 
- States/s 
- States/s/core
- Power usage (if known)


Example:
- Santiago Betelu, UNT
- UT's Stampede2, 256 nodes, Knight's Landing 64 cores used, total cores 16384, Infiniband network
- Qubits: 41
- States/s: 4.4e11
- States/s/core: 2.7e7
- Power usage unknown
