### Please test the ability of your computer to perform quantum circuit simulations as follows:

A) First run the benchmark with increasing number of nodes/cores until you get the highest performance in the column "States/s". That usually corresponds to the largest number of qubits that you can simulate (column Qubits), and the largest number of nodes you can run.  

B) Verify that you get the "Pass=yes" result on all rows.

C) Select the row with the highest performance and submit your results to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVwp_4FZJWyS5UsfBrtxq8PXkKJLoRvgHkpfTuOuJ-wcudiw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">QuanSimBench Submission</a>

D) You can see results posted in our github
