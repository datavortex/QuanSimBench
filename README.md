Quantum factorization simulation as a benchmark for HPC

Why quantum factorization as a benchmark
• Quantum factorization a widely known & relevant problem
• Easy to validate and understand
• Each additional qubit doubles RAM usage, CPU power and internode communication: good to test large machines
• Runs in a reasonable time: 1-3 hours
• Portable with less than 300 lines of C and MPI
• It just runs: no input or special knowledge from user
• Runs from a laptop to a large supercomputer
